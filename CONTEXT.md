Create a modern, minimalist, and visually appealing campaign website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (use external frameworks like Tailwind CSS or others only if they improve the result). The site promotes Nataniel Czubak, a student running for school council. It should be fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

The website should include:

A clean hero section with Nataniel’s name and a short slogan like "Fresh Ideas. Real Change."

A short "About Nataniel" section describing who he is and what he stands for.

A simple list of goals or campaign promises using bullet points or icons.

A small, tasteful mention that the site was made by his friend Miłosz, who is also running.

A call-to-action encouraging students to vote for Nataniel.

Use a calm, student-friendly color palette (e.g., soft tones or light neutrals).

Smooth scroll and subtle animations are welcome.

Focus on clean layout, good spacing, and readability.

If using frameworks improves responsiveness, design, or interactivity, feel free to use them.

Avoid clutter. The overall tone should be friendly, trustworthy, and easy to navigate.
